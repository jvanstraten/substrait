Basic script to test the output of Isthmus for TPC-H with the validator.
Doesn't actually fail on validation errors or whatever; just outputs HTML files
for the queries, for as far as they don't actually break Isthmus.

The validator Python module must be installed first, but Isthmus is built
automatically.
